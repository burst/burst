"""
This module takes care of tracking started moves, be they joint moves
or walking (joint moves can be decomposed to head and body, but that's
all the same).

There are two strategies: The old and mostly working, the new and exciting.

Old and mostly working:
 * every postid we get from a started action is returned here. They are
  all 'tokens' to be used via ALMotion to poll it 'isRunning(postid)'
  repeatedly.
 * the polling is done through calc_events, which is called by world, which
  holds our instance and calls us at the beginning (relatively) of each frame.
 * the mass of code is to do less polling - we have a SerialPostQueue dealing
  with actions that are serial in nature, and so we don't poll for the second
  while the first is still returning "True".
 * otherwise we just poll for all.
 * we use BurstDeferreds to carry the callback. We don't actually call it,
  we return it via the list given in calc_events, EventManager does the calling

New and annoyingly thready:
 * create a thread for every move queue with it's own ALProxy("ALMotion",ip,port)
  * three queus (can use two actually):
   * one queue for head
   * one queue for walk
   * one queue for body moves
  * if body move includes head, head queue is marked blocked.
  * if someone wants to cancel, we will try:
   * request cancel (in main thread), hope that remote naoqi finishes the call (writes and closes socket)
   * request cancel, and cancel our thread (and the socket we hope won't be left dangling)
  * call backs done almost the same - we check for new results from the threads, which include
   the bd's given to the user, and return it via calc_events called from world.

    There is a isRunning, but if we call it before the motion has started, it

    have been already done. This is a specialization for the case of multiple
    consecutive motions, like head moves and walks. We just remember the time
